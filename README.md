#### Requirement
Based on https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api 
you need to register and go to your GIPHY Developer Dashboard. Get started by creating an app, where you will be assigned a beta API key, copy the key and paste it inside the file env.env
```
 REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key
```
Rename the file env.env to .env

Once you are ready to use your app in production, please verify your GIPHY integration, if needed, and upgrade your key by clicking on ‘Upgrade to Production’.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
